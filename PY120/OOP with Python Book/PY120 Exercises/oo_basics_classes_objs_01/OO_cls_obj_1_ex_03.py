# Create the Object
# Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.

class Cat:
    pass

kitty = Cat() #We don't want to put any strings inside the () yet because the Cat class doesn't take any arguments yet. Giving an argument, such as the name of the cat, would raise an error. Even though Cat only has a pass statement, Python still knows how to make an instance of it.
