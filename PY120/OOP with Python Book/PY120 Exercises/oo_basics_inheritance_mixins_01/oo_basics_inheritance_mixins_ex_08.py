# Method Resolution Path (Part 1)
# Using the code below, determine the method resolution order (MRO) used when accessing the cat1.color property. Only list the classes that are checked by Python when searching for the color attribute. Do not use the mro method.

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self._color = color

    @property
    def color(self):
        return self._color

class Cat(Animal):
    pass

class Bird(Animal):
    pass

cat1 = Cat('Black')
print(cat1.color) # MRO = Cat, Animal, object # Don't forget object is the last class that is checked!
