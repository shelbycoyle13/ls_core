# Create a function that takes 2 arguments, a list and a dictionary. The list will contain 2 or more elements that, when joined with spaces, will produce a person's name. The dictionary will contain two keys, "title" and "occupation", and the appropriate values. Your function should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

def greetings(lst, dictionary):
    name = " ".join(lst)
    job = dictionary["title"] + " " + dictionary["occupation"]
    return (f'Hello, {name}! Nice to have a {job} around.')


greeting = greetings(
    ["John", "Q", "Doe"],
    {"title": "Master", "occupation": "Plumber"},
)
print(greeting)
# Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.
